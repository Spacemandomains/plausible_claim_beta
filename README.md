A test to learn if your facts are enough for a plausible claim

⚖️ Federal Retaliation Claim Game ⚖️This repository hosts the source code and documentation for the Federal Retaliation Claim Game, a structured, interactive simulation designed to test the user's ability to construct a legally plausible retaliation claim under federal statutes (e.g., Title VII, ADEA).🚀 How It Works (Mechanism & State Flow)The application simulates a pleading process by forcing the user (the Plaintiff) to provide specific factual allegations for the three core elements of a retaliation claim. The simulation maintains game state based on the completeness and quality of the inputs.1. The State MachineThe game operates on a simple, sequential state machine that guides the Plaintiff through the necessary legal elements.StatePrompt FocusValidation LogicSTATE 1Protected ActivityChecks for specific actions: Opposition (complaining internally/externally about discrimination) or Participation (filing a charge, testifying, etc.).STATE 2Adverse Employment Action (AEA)Checks for an action that is materially adverse (e.g., termination, demotion, significant change in duties) and is taken by the employer.STATE 3Causal Connection / But-For CauseChecks for temporal proximity (closeness in time between Protected Activity and AEA) and/or circumstantial evidence (e.g., management comments, deviation from policy).FINALRulingLogic executes the Plausibility Tally based on the accumulated facts and provides a final legal assessment.2. Core Logic: Plausibility TallyThe Judge's final ruling is driven by a hidden scoring mechanism—the Plausibility Tally. Each specific, non-conclusory fact provided by the Plaintiff accrues points toward a "Plausible" threshold.Fact Specificity: Vague statements ("My boss was mean") score 0 points. Specific details ("On June 1st, I reported harassment to HR") score +1 point.Temporal Proximity: Providing a tight timeline (e.g., AEA occurred $< 2$ months after Protected Activity) scores an additional +2 points in STATE 3.Deviation from Policy: Providing a fact that suggests the employer broke its own rules (e.g., "I was fired without the required written warnings") scores +1 point in STATE 3.$$P_{Total} = \sum_{i=1}^{3} (F_{i} + T_{i} + D_{i})$$Where:$P_{Total}$ is the total Plausibility Score.$F_i$ is the score for specific facts in each state.$T_i$ is the bonus for temporal proximity (only in State 3).$D_i$ is the bonus for policy deviation (only in State 3).3. Ruling ThresholdsThe final assessment is determined by the $P_{Total}$:RulingRequired PTotal​ImplicationWeak Claim$P_{Total} < 3$Fails to meet the basic prima facie burden. Likely dismissed on a Motion to Dismiss.Factually Plausible$3 \le P_{Total} < 6$Meets the Twiqbal pleading standard. Sufficient to survive early motions and proceed to discovery.Legally Strong$P_{Total} \ge 6$Presents compelling, specific, and closely-timed evidence. Highly favorable for the Plaintiff at the summary judgment stage.🛠️ Technical StackThe front-end presentation and interactive components are built using standard web technologies:HTML: Provides the structural containers for the game interface (prompt areas, input fields, and the final ruling display).CSS: Styles the interface for a clean, professional, and easily scannable "legal document" look.JavaScript (JS): Handles all game logic, state transitions, input parsing/validation (via regex or LLM assessment), and the final calculation of the $P_{Total}$ score.🤝 Contribution and MaintenanceThis repository and simulation are maintained by the Pro Se Argument initiative. Our mission is to provide accessible, structured tools for individuals representing themselves in legal matters to understand core legal pleading standards.We welcome contributions focused on:Refining the Plausibility Tally scoring logic for greater legal fidelity.Expanding the scope to include defenses (Employer's Legitimate Non-Retaliatory Reason - LNR).Improving the front-end user experience for clarity and accessibility.
